            <p class="p1-decoration">We provide craft training and educational programs to promote women's economic and personal independence, since 2016. We believe that providing education on fair trade and self-sufficiency is key to creating new life-changing economic and social opportunities. We train our women primarily in textile processing and decor making. In addition to craft training, we educate our women in finance, fair trade, sales, and support them on their path to becoming independent entrepreneurs.</p>

            <p class="p2-decoration">Project Tres helps women in India Kenya on their way to economic and personal independence. We provide handcraft training and educate our women to become independent entrepreneurs. During the Covid-19 pandemic, many of our mothers' families lost the sources of income they had outside of Project Tres, making our organization the only source of income and support. Our previous five years of hard work have been negatively impacted by COVID-19, undermining their progress and development.</p>
